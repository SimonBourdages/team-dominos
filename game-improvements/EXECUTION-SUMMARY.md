# Team Dominos - Rapid Improvement Execution

## Current Status

### Cycle 1: Foundation & Core Features ⚙️ IN PROGRESS

**Research Complete:**  
✅ 10 agents analyzed similar games and compiled comprehensive feedback

**Planning Complete:**  
✅ Created detailed improvement plan with 50+ features prioritized

**Implementation Status:**
- 10 implementation agents launched
- Agents taking 5-10 minutes each (currently at 6+ minutes)
- Code changes being made (4500+ lines modified)
- CSS for achievements, skill trees, tutorials already added

**Current Actions:**
1. Agents continuing work in background
2. Changes being incrementally committed
3. Testing game stability
4. Preparing for rapid iteration

## Pragmatic Approach for Remaining Cycles

Given the complexity and time requirements, here's the adjusted strategy:

### Modified Execution Plan:

**Cycles 1-3: Core Feature Implementation**
- Focus: Multiplayer, retention systems, gameplay enhancements
- Approach: Let current agents complete, integrate and test
- Timeline: ~30-60 minutes

**Cycles 4-6: Polish & Optimization**  
- Focus: Visual feedback, mobile optimization, performance
- Approach: Targeted improvements based on Cycle 1-3 learnings
- Timeline: ~20-40 minutes

**Cycles 7-9: Advanced Features**
- Focus: Procedural generation, advanced multiplayer, social features
- Approach: Build on stable foundation from earlier cycles
- Timeline: ~20-40 minutes

**Cycle 10: Final Integration**
- Focus: Bug fixes, balance, deployment, documentation
- Approach: Comprehensive testing and polish
- Timeline: ~20 minutes

## Key Insights from Research

### What Makes Games Successful:
1. **Multiplayer** - #1 requested feature (implementing now)
2. **Retention Systems** - 25% engagement boost (achievements, daily challenges)
3. **Visual Feedback** - Makes actions feel impactful
4. **Progressive Difficulty** - Balance casual and hardcore players
5. **Content Variety** - Procedural generation prevents staleness

### What Kills Games:
1. **Lag/Performance Issues** - Critical to optimize
2. **Unfair Difficulty** - Must be skill-based, not RNG
3. **Repetitive Content** - Need variety and freshness
4. **Poor Onboarding** - Tutorial system essential
5. **Lack of Progression** - Players need meaningful growth

## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. **Single File Architecture** - index.html is now very large (5000+ lines)
   - Acceptable for prototype/MVP
   - May need modularization in future cycles

2. **No Backend** - Currently all client-side
   - Fine for local multiplayer and single-player features
   - Will need backend for online multiplayer (Cycles 7-9)

3. **Performance** - Must monitor with 4-player split-screen
   - Target: 60 FPS desktop, 30 FPS mobile
   - May need quality settings and adaptive rendering

4. **Testing** - Manual testing currently
   - Need automated tests in later cycles
   - User feedback critical for balance

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ✅ Wait for agent implementations to stabilize (~5-10 more minutes)
2. ⏳ Review and test agent changes
3. ⏳ Fix any conflicts or bugs
4. ⏳ Commit Cycle 1 complete features  
5. ⏳ Launch Cycle 2 improvements
6. ⏳ Repeat through Cycle 10

---

## Success Metrics (To Track Post-Deployment)

- **Engagement:** Session time, return rate
- **Multiplayer:** % of games using local multiplayer
- **Retention:** Daily challenge completion, achievement progress
- **Performance:** FPS, load time, crash rate
- **Player Feedback:** GitHub issues, social media mentions

---

**Status:** Agents working, continuous progress being made.  
**Estimated Completion:** All 10 cycles within 2-4 hours total.  
**Current Focus:** Stabilizing Cycle 1 implementations.
