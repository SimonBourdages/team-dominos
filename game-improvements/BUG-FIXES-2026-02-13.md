# Bug Fixes - February 13, 2026

## Critical Gameplay Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Character Too Slow ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Movement speed was 5 units, making navigation tedious  
**Solution:** Increased to 15 units (3x faster)  
**Impact:** Character now moves at proper platformer speed

### Issue #2: Can't Jump First Gap ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Jump height was 8 units, insufficient for gap jumps  
**Solution:** Increased to 18 units (2.25x higher)  
**Impact:** Player can now easily clear gaps and platforms

### Issue #3: Infinite Falling ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** No death boundary, player falls forever  
**Solution:** Added death check at Y = -20 with respawn function  
**Impact:** Player now respawns at level start when falling off

### Issue #4: Harsh Gravity ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Gravity of 25 made jumps feel too heavy  
**Solution:** Reduced to 20 for smoother jump arc  
**Impact:** More satisfying jump feel, better control
