# Team Dominos: Engine-Building Redesign

## 🎮 Core Game Loop

**"Start Manual, End Automated"** - The Universal Paperclips Formula

---

## 🔄 Three Phases with Two Major Evolutions

### **PHASE 1: "Manual Delivery" (The Grind)**
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Core Mechanic:** Pure manual 3D platforming

**Gameplay:**
- You ARE the delivery person
- Run through 3D platformer levels
- Manually collect OKRs (golden cubes)
- Manually deliver to Jrod at level end
- Each delivery earns: **Delivery Points (DP)**

**The Engine Building Starts:**
```
Upgrades You Can Buy with DP:
├─ Movement Speed: 5 DP → 10 DP → 20 DP → 40 DP
├─ Jump Height: 5 DP → 10 DP → 20 DP → 40 DP
├─ Carry Capacity: 10 DP → 25 DP → 50 DP (carry more OKRs)
├─ Sprint Duration: 15 DP → 30 DP → 60 DP
└─ **Auto-Collect Radius: 50 DP** ← FIRST AUTOMATION!
```

**Progression Milestones:**
- 0-50 DP: Pure manual, learning the ropes
- 50-100 DP: Auto-collect OKRs (walk near them = auto pickup)
- 100-200 DP: Faster movement, easier platforming
- 200-500 DP: Max stats, ready for first evolution

**When You Hit 500 DP Total:**
> **"You've mastered manual delivery. Time to scale up."**
> **→ EVOLUTION 1 TRIGGERED ←**

---

### **🔥 EVOLUTION 1: "The Team System" (First Reset)**

**What Happens:**
1. **You get promoted to "Manager"**
2. **Game resets but keeps:** Unlocked levels, character stats (50% retained)
3. **New currency:** Management Points (MP) replace Delivery Points
4. **NEW MECHANIC UNLOCKED:** **Hire AI Teammates**

---

### **PHASE 2: "Team Management" (The Automation)**
**Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Core Mechanic:** Platforming + Managing AI workforce

**The Dynamic Changes:**
- You still platformer through levels
- But now you can **hire AI teammates** who deliver for you
- AI teammates run simpler paths autonomously
- You focus on complex routes and collecting "Management Points"

**The Engine Evolves:**
```
AI Teammate System:
├─ Hire Runner 1: 10 MP (delivers 1 OKR/minute)
├─ Hire Runner 2: 25 MP (delivers 2 OKRs/minute)
├─ Hire Runner 3: 50 MP (delivers 3 OKRs/minute)
├─ Upgrade Runner Speed: 20 MP per level
├─ Upgrade Runner Capacity: 30 MP per level
└─ Hire Manager: 200 MP (auto-manages runners)

Special Upgrades:
├─ Coffee Station: 100 MP (runners work 50% faster)
├─ Delivery Hub: 150 MP (passive OKR generation)
├─ Training Room: 200 MP (runners learn complex routes)
└─ **Automation Node: 500 MP** ← KEY UNLOCK
```

**The Game Flow Changes:**
- Early Phase 2: You deliver + 3 AI helpers deliver
- Mid Phase 2: You mostly manage + occasional platforming for bonuses
- Late Phase 2: AI does most work, you optimize routes

**Progression Milestones:**
- 0-100 MP: Hire first 3 runners, still mostly manual
- 100-500 MP: Runners doing 50% of work, you do complex routes
- 500-1000 MP: Runners doing 80% of work, you just optimize
- 1000-2000 MP: Nearly passive, collecting for final push

**When You Hit 2000 MP Total:**
> **"Your team is too efficient. Corporate wants full automation."**
> **→ EVOLUTION 2 TRIGGERED ←**

---

### **🚀 EVOLUTION 2: "The Automation Era" (Second Reset)**

**What Happens:**
1. **You become "Director of Automation"**
2. **Game resets but keeps:** All team members (25% speed), previous upgrades (25% strength)
3. **New currency:** Automation Credits (AC)
4. **NEW MECHANIC UNLOCKED:** **Build Automated Pipelines**

---

### **PHASE 3: "Full Automation" (The Transcendence)**
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Core Mechanic:** Watch your empire work, optimize the machine

**The Final Dynamic:**
- Minimal platforming (only for special bonuses)
- **Build conveyor belt systems** through levels
- **Place automation nodes** that process OKRs
- **Deploy AI managers** that optimize themselves
- **Exponential growth** - thousands of OKRs per second

**The Ultimate Engine:**
```
Automation System:
├─ Conveyor Belt: 50 AC (auto-transport OKRs)
├─ Processing Node: 100 AC (auto-deliver OKRs)
├─ Efficiency Core: 200 AC (2x all production)
├─ Quantum Processor: 500 AC (10x all production)
├─ AI Director: 1000 AC (self-optimizing system)
└─ **The Singularity: 5000 AC** ← FINAL UPGRADE

Special Buildings:
├─ OKR Factory: Generates OKRs passively
├─ Clone Lab: Duplicates best AI workers
├─ Research Center: Unlocks new tech trees
└─ **The Cloud**: Upload consciousness for infinite scaling
```

**The Final Shift:**
- Early Phase 3: Building your first automated pipeline
- Mid Phase 3: Exponential growth kicks in (hundreds/sec)
- Late Phase 3: Thousands per second, watching numbers go brrr
- End Phase 3: One final choice...

**When You Hit 10,000 Total OKRs Delivered:**
> **"You've achieved perfect efficiency. One question remains..."**
> **→ FINAL CHOICE ←**

---

## 🏁 THE ENDING

*"The system works perfectly without you. Do you..."*

**Choice A: "Retire"** (Human Ending)
- Step away, let the machines work
- Watch credits as OKRs continue delivering
- Unlock "Observer Mode" - watch automation forever
- **Achievement: "Graceful Exit"**

**Choice B: "Optimize Further"** (Efficiency Ending)
- Become part of the system
- Merge with the automation
- Achieve perfect delivery (1M OKRs/sec)
- **Achievement: "Digital Transformation Complete"**

**Choice C: "Start Over"** (Prestige Ending)
- Reset everything for permanent bonuses
- **New Game+** with 2x stats
