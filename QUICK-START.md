## Your Mission

1. **Collect all 3 golden OKR cubes** in each level
2. **Reach Jrod's building** (big building with red roof)
3. **Don't fall off!** You have 3 lives
4. **Complete fast** for more stars (under 30 sec = 3 stars)

## Tips for Success

- **Level 1-2**: Practice your jumping timing on gaps
- **Level 3+**: Wait for moving platforms to come to you
- **Level 4+**: Avoid red enemy cubes (they respawn you)
- **After Level 3**: You unlock double jump! Press Space twice
- **Use Sprint**: Hold Shift to move faster, but harder to control
- **Take Your Time**: Lives are precious, don't rush unnecessarily

## What Each Level Teaches

- **Level 1**: Basic movement and jumping
- **Level 2**: Jump timing across gaps
- **Level 3**: Moving platform navigation (UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT)
- **Level 4**: Enemy avoidance (red cubes patrol)
- **Level 5**: Boss battle in arena
- **Level 6**: Vertical climbing challenge
- **Level 7**: 3D navigation (platforms on Z-axis)
- **Level 8**: Precision jumps on tiny platforms
- **Level 9**: Everything combined + double moving platforms
- **Level 10**: Final challenge with all mechanics

## Troubleshooting

**Game won't load?**
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check internet connection (loads Three.js from CDN)
- Open browser console (F12) to check for errors

**Can't move?**
- Click on the game window to focus it
- Make sure you're not in a menu screen
- Press ESC to unpause if paused

**Falling through platforms?**
- This is intentional if you hit the edge
- Try to land in the center of platforms
- Use sprint carefully near edges

**Controls not working?**
- Click the game canvas to give it focus
- Try pressing keys again
- Refresh the page (F5)

## Scoring System

### Stars (per level)
- ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars): Complete in under 30 seconds with all OKRs
- ⭐⭐ (2 stars): Complete in under 60 seconds with all OKRs
- ⭐ (1 star): Complete with all OKRs

### Lives
- Start with: ❤️❤️❤️ (3 hearts)

## Pro Tips

1. **Learn the levels**: Each level has a pattern, memorize it
2. **Use camera angle**: The camera follows you, plan your jumps
3. **Sprint on long platforms**: Save time on easy sections
4. **Wait for enemies**: Let them patrol away before crossing
5. **Double jump strategically**: Don't waste it, you only get one
6. **Collect OKRs early**: Don't backtrack, get them as you go
7. **Practice makes perfect**: Failed a level? Try again, you'll improve!
